## Introduction
Hello and welcome to the PHP section of my Portfolio. In this section I will be talking about how we bult a custom CMS with PHP basically being the core of it. I am also going to talk about how we rendered some of these templates using PHP. This project really showed me what PHP can do and how similar it CAN be to javascript, still a lot of differences but also a lot of similarities... even with Python now that I think about, but well talk about that in another section. Thank you for your time and as always I hope you find this to be as informative and helpful to your cause. Lets dive in.
