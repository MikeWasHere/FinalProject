# CSS animation

## Introduction
Css Animation is becoming a big thing in the web industry. The beauty about it is how they give the websites a more polished and fluid look to it. Its the icing on the cake and I dont know about you, but I love icing. In this section I will be talking about what CSS animations are and how they work, Why are they important and what value they bring, how to get started on implementing them on your site, and what SVG's are how to use them when it comes to animation.

### What are CSS Animations?
So, what are CSS animations? They are animations that you can use to animate different properties on the page to make them do what you'd like. Some people make bouncing balls. Some people make animated backgrounds. Most people make small transitions like when you hover over a button it changes color subtly instead on an instant. They help make your page look and feel more fluid and nice. In my opinion it gives your page life.

### Why are they important now?
Things have ben shifting in way that CSS animations are becoming more and more used through out websites like [Facebook](facebook.com) When you like or react to someones post and [Twitter](twitter.com) when you like someones post or even when you scroll down a list to see more tweets the way it loads is also a form of animation. Even some local Orlando website firms use animations like [designzilla.com](https://www.designzillas.com/) as you can see there site looks more fluid and alive. Sites like that leave an impression on users and thats why I personally love to use them myself. Go to a project I did called [bbaklava](https://bbaklava.firebaseapp.com) and you can see how I used these animations very subtly withing the site.

### How to get started
There are many different libraries that are there that help you get the animations up and running. The great thing about them is that there super easy to install and get them going. For instance, lets say you want to use some hover effects you will go to one of my favorite sites for hover animations [hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) This guy (Ian Lunn) shares this library for free for any one to use. So lets say we want to add that when you hover over a button, it buzzes. What do you do?
* Step 1: Download the library / Put the ```hover.css``` file inside your CSS directory.
* Step 2: Apply the class ```class="hvr-buzz"``` to the button element, it should look like this ```<button class="hvr-buzz">Click me!</button> ```
* THATS IT! its that simple implementing hover.css animations to your site. Some other animations will require more complex timing and other ways of doing it by using ```@keyframes``` to control every aspect of the element.
