## Introduction

Hello and welcome to BBaklava project. In this project I worked on numerous things including, marketing plan and designing the whole brand in general - That is called Branding. I enjoyed this project very much. I always enjoyed designing and making things look nice and simple. I also enjoy making the UI for website very easy and intuitive to use. What I am going to focus on here is what libraries I used to make this project awesome. One of the Libraries i used for this project is called Angular.

In this Project I will talk about how I used Angular to make a E-commerce CMS on a small online store. I will talk about how I used Routes to render the specific HTML needed. I will talk about how Angular Modals were used to bind any form elements in the HTML and store into a variable that would be able to be used throughout the website. I will also touch upon, my personal favorite, CSS animations! how I used subtle animations to make the website more user friendly and give it a smoother field. I hope you guys enjoy this section, lets get to work.
